This document defines the conditions under which Phase 4 is considered complete.
It does not introduce new capabilities or policy.
Its sole purpose is to prevent capability expansion before guardrails are stable.


# Phase 4 — Completion Criteria

Phase 4 is considered complete when:

- All future capabilities are gated by explicit policy
- No capability sketch violates reversibility or consent rules
- Job-related questions are handled via reframing, not recommendations
- Longitudinal memory is explicitly opt-in and off by default
- No population comparisons or diagnostic labels are permitted
- Disagreement is treated as valid signal, not correction

Only after these constraints are stable may new intelligence be added.


Only after Phase 4 criteria are met may the project explore:

- AI-generated reflection *selection* (not creation)
- Adaptive question phrasing
- Optional longitudinal awareness

Any new capability must reference this document before implementation.
